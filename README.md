# end-me
this took way longer than it should have.

This was made as a project for my computer science class in python. I worked on this with 2 other people (Rathiin and Aditya). This took way too much time to complete. Rathiin, Aditya and me made equal contributions to the project. It might not function as intended or at all, but that's just what you get with 3 idiots trying to do this.
